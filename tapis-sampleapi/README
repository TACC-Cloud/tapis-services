Creating from Scratch in Eclipse
--------------------------------
There are many paths to creating a project in Eclipse, but only some of them work for a given
application.  Our web application uses JAX-RS, so the ordering of actions during creation is 
critical.  Here's one recipe that works.

1. Create a new maven project with no archetype.
    - Edit pom.xml to make it look like the one in tapis-sampleapi.
2. Right click the project name in the Navigator.
    - Select Properties->Project Facets
    - Click the "convert to a facets project" link.
    - Select the JavaScript, Dynamic Web Module, JAX-RS facets in addition to the Java
        - Java -> version 12 or higher
        - Dynamic Web Module -> version 4.0 or higher
        - JAX-RS -> version 2.1 or higher 
    - Save
3. Right click the project name in the Navigator.
    - Select Properties->Deployment Assembly
    - Press Add
    - Select Maven Dependencies
    - Save
4. Make sure the web.xml in WebContent/WEB-INF references the Jersey servlet.
5. Create an index.html file in WebContent directory.
6. The context root will be tapis-sampleapi by default.  Change the by right clicking the
   project name, then Properties->Web Context Settings and setting the Context Root.
    - Making the context root and the war file name (finalName in pom) the same will 
      probably make life easier.
