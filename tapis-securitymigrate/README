Tapis Migrate
=============

Tapis Migrate uses flyway to migrate Tapis's Security Kernel postgres database schema, which is separate from the migration facility for Tapis's services database.  

sql scripts must reside in the main/resources/edu/utexas/tacc/tapis/securitymigrate/sql directory.

jdbc scripts must reside in the main/java/edu/utexas/tacc/tapis/securitymigrate/scripts directory.


Usage
-----
The TapisJDBCMigrate program invokes flyway to update the schema when new scripts are 
deployed.  The "tapis" user should be created before migration.  The "tapissecdb" will be created if necessary.
