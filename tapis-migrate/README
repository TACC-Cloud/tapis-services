Tapis Migrate
=============

Tapis Migrate uses flyway to migrate Tapis's postgres database schema.  In the current design
the schemas of all Tapis services are defined and managed using one set of scripts.  These
scripts are defined in this project and follow the required flyway naming scheme.  This 
effectively treats Tapis as an application with a single schema and this full schema must be
installed in any database that has at least one Tapis service running against it.

sql scripts must reside in the main/resources/edu/utexas/tacc/tapis/migrate/sql directory.

jdbc scripts must reside in the main/java/edu/utexas/tacc/tapis/migrate/scripts directory.


Usage
-----
The TapisJDBCMigrate program invokes flyway to update the schema when new scripts are 
deployed.  The "tapis" user should be created before migration.  The "tapisdb" will be created
if necessary.
